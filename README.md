# The Index of Rust Language Project
I am trying to do something on Rust project, before that it needs to build up proper help tools, that is, rebuild some gears. First thing first, I need to know what gears I need that doesn't have a proper implement. So how about make a list/index of the rust I found might useful to me or someone else?  Let me do it now.... :)

## Standard of my selection
##### Score
The index only relative to the works i might be interested in.
##### Not Score
The projects need not be 'awesome' as those 'Awesome XXX project' listed. The index would not be a try of complete list of Rust Language project.

## Search Method Description
The results cames from search feature of github UI and keyword as 'Rust' and filter as 'Rust Language'.
status:
1. https://github.com/search?l=Rust&p=12&q=rust&type=Repositories
2. https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/rust?projectPage=6

Flowgger supports common input types: stdin, UDP, TCP, TLS and Redis, as well as multiple input formats: JSON (GELF), LTSV, Cap'n Proto and RFC5424. Normalized messages can be sent to Kafka, Graylog, to downstream Flowgger servers, or to other log collectors for further processing. https://github.com/awslabs/flowgger/wiki

I originally wanted DataFusion to be a distributed compute platform but this was overly ambitious at the time, and it ended up becoming an in-memory single-threaded query execution engine for the Rust implementation of Apache Arrow. However, DataFusion now provides a good foundation to have another attempt at building a modern distributed compute platform in Rust.

The API exposed by zmq should be safe (in the usual Rust sense), but it follows the C API closely, so it is not very idiomatic. Also, support for libzmq API in "draft" state is considered out-of-scope for this crate; this includes currently, as of libzmq 4.3.3: Newer, thread-safe socket types, such as ZMQ_CLIENT and ZMQ_SERVER; The "poller" API. For a more modern, idiomatic approach to libzmq bindings, including draft API features, have a look at libzmq-rs(https://github.com/jean-airoldie/libzmq-rs).

If a node goes down in your infrastructure, you receive a status change notification in a Slack channel, Email, Twilio SMS or/and XMPP. who use it? Crisp; Meili; miragespace; Redsmin; Image-Charts.
* [2019-10-29][Active] https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust - Cap'n Proto is a type system for distributed systems. You can then use the capnp tool to generate code in a variety of programming languages. The generated code lets you produce and consume values of the types you've defined in your schema. Values are encoded in a format(https://capnproto.org/encoding.html) that is suitable not only for transmission over a network and persistence to disk, but also for zero-copy in-memory traversal. That is, you can completely skip serialization and deserialization! It's in this sense that Cap'n Proto is "infinity times faster" than alternatives like Protocol Buffers. * [2019-10-30][Active] https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto Cap'n Proto serialization/RPC system - core tools and C++ library.
