# The Index of Rust Language Project
I am trying to do something on Rust project, before that it needs to build up proper help tools, that is, rebuild some gears. First thing first, I need to know what gears I need that doesn't have a proper implement. So how about make a list/index of the rust I found might useful to me or someone else?  Let me do it now.... :)

## Standard of my selection
Score
The index only relative to the works i might be interested in.
Not Score
The projects need not be 'awesome' as those 'Awesome XXX project' listed. The index would be a try of complete list of Rust Language project even it might be *complete* if nutcases are enough to fulfill the impossible task.

## Search Method Description
The results cames from search feature of github UI and keyword as 'Rust' and filter as 'Rust Language'.
status:
https://github.com/search?l=Rust&p=12&q=rust&type=Repositories

## Similar Works
https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust - I have to read it too :D. There are some diff of mine against that list.
https://crates.io/ full list of crates.

## Okey, Now the list
