# The Index of Rust Language Project
I am trying to do something on Rust project, before that it needs to build up proper help tools, that is, rebuild some gears. First thing first, I need to know what gears I need that doesn't have a proper implement. So how about make a list/index of the rust I found might useful to me or someone else?  Let me do it now.... :)

## Standard of my selection
##### Score
The index only relative to the works i might be interested in.
##### Not Score
The projects need not be 'awesome' as those 'Awesome XXX project' listed. The index would not be a try of complete list of Rust Language project.

## Search Method Description
The results cames from search feature of github UI and keyword as 'Rust' and filter as 'Rust Language'.
status:
1. https://github.com/search?l=Rust&p=12&q=rust&type=Repositories
2. https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/rust?projectPage=6

[2019-10-28][Active] https://github.com/redox-os/termion - Termion is a pure Rust, bindless library for low-level handling, manipulating and reading information about terminals. This provides a full-featured alternative to Termbox. ref: https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go
Termbox is a library that provides a minimalistic API which allows the programmer to write text-based user interfaces. The library is crossplatform and has both terminal-based implementations on *nix operating systems and a winapi console based implementation for windows operating systems. The basic idea is an abstraction of the greatest common subset of features available on all major terminals and other terminal-like APIs in a minimalistic fashion. Small API means it is easy to implement, test, maintain and learn it, that's what makes the termbox a distinct library in its area.

### IoT
[2019-10-23][Active] https://github.com/dcuddeback/termios-rs - The termios crate provides safe bindings for the Rust programming language to the terminal I/O interface implemented by Unix operating systems.
[2019-10-23][Active] https://github.com/dcuddeback/libusb-rs - This crate provides a safe wrapper around the native libusb library. It applies the RAII pattern and Rust lifetimes to ensure safe usage of all libusb functionality. All systems supported by the native libusb library are also supported by the libusb crate. It's been tested on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
[2019-10-23][Active] https://github.com/dcuddeback/libusb-sys - the libusb-sys crate provides declarations and linkage for the libusb C library. Following the *-sys package conventions, the libusb-sys crate does not define higher-level abstractions over the native libusb library functions.
